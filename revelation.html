                    The Propaganda of religion: In the modern perspective religion is nothing but another name for
                    propaganda for people, in which they believe and will sacrifice themselves and kill people in the
                    name of religion. Religion in a broader sense started as a tool of rationality as the man was too
                    afraid of certain things, earlier religion tried to reason things but as there is no space for
                    improvements people take them as the only sole reason of life, they'd believe on some fancy pants
                    prophet or arabian barbaric man than a person who has the ability to think, religion now has no
                    other meaning, politicians and corrupt people use it for their convenience, take any example Islam,
                    Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism to some extent, all these religions are the reason people are
                    dying, bombings, terrorist attacks, all are because of religious extremism, most people who we think
                    are very wise, intelligent, successful are either agnostics or atheists.

                <h4 class="heading">The Education System</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">The current education system often pressures students to focus solely on
                    competitive exams and traditional jobs, turning them into "slaves" of a rigid and stressful system.
                    Schools impose useless rules and emphasize conformity, creating an environment that stifles critical
                    thinking and discourages students from questioning what is right or wrong. This system is the
                    leading cause of student depression, as it constantly threatens that failing to meet academic
                    standards will result in a failed life, which is far from the truth. Students blindly follow school
                    and government directives, not realizing that this system is designed to produce compliant workers
                    for jobs in government or private companies, maintaining the status quo of existing societal rules.
                    To break free from this cycle, students need to explore alternative paths such as entrepreneurship,
                    creative fields, or skilled trades. By pursuing their own interests and talents, they can escape the
                    confines of a limiting system and find more fulfilling and successful careers.

                <h4 class="heading">Depressed Generation</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">This generation is experiencing high levels of depression, influenced by an
                    education system that was originally designed to create obedient workers rather than independent
                    thinkers. The pressure to conform and succeed within this rigid system often leaves students feeling
                    stressed, unfulfilled, and disconnected from their passions. Additionally, toxic feminism, with its
                    extreme views and divisive rhetoric, can create a hostile environment where young men feel unjustly
                    targeted and young women feel pressured to adopt overly aggressive stances on gender issues. The
                    increase in nudity and explicit content in media, partly influenced by certain feminist perspectives
                    on freedom of expression, further complicates matters. This content often sends mixed messages about
                    body image and self-worth, contributing to anxiety, depression, and unrealistic expectations about
                    relationships and sexuality. Together, these factors create a perfect storm of pressure and
                    confusion, leading to a generation that is struggling to find its identity, purpose, and sense of
                    well-being. To address these issues, we need to reform the education system to foster creativity and
                    critical thinking, promote balanced and inclusive feminism, and encourage media responsibility and
                    healthy portrayals of relationships and self-worth.

                <h4 class="heading">Hopeless Paths</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Many people find themselves on hopeless paths, working tirelessly towards their
                    goals but
                    feeling uncertain about their chances of success. Despite their best efforts, they often face
                    setbacks and
                    frustration, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness and depression. For some, these persistent
                    failures
                    can escalate to severe mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts, self-harm, or even
                    suicide. In
                    this generation, where cheating often seems to outweigh loyalty, finding genuine support is
                    increasingly
                    difficult. The responsibility to create a happy and low-stress environment lies with the government,
                    which
                    should focus on policies and systems that promote mental well-being and support for its citizens.
                    However,
                    the greediness for money and power often leads to a failure in addressing these crucial needs,
                    leaving
                    individuals to navigate their struggles largely on their own. This neglect can exacerbate feelings
                    of
                    isolation and helplessness, making it even harder for people to find the support they need to cope
                    with
                    stress and depression.<br>
                    Clearly, life can be especially challenging for those who refuse to blindly follow societal norms
                    and
                    question accepted beliefs. While many conform to traditional paths—such as accepting religious
                    doctrines,
                    adhering to the idea that the education system is perfect, or striving solely for top grades—those
                    who think
                    independently and challenge these norms often face greater difficulties. Their critical thinking and
                    refusal
                    to follow the crowd can make their journey more isolating and frustrating, as they navigate a world
                    that
                    frequently values conformity over individual thought and integrity.

                <p class="paragraph">LGBTQIA+ is a mental illness commonly associated with individuals who find it
                    difficult to face the realities of the real world. These people tend to reject the natural order of
                    things and are heavily influenced by figures in popular culture, often seeking escape through these
                    means. Most of the LGBTQIA+ influencers and followers are weak and often stemming from backgrounds
                    where they were not encouraged to develop strong coping ability. These weak people often create an
                    alternate reality for themselves. In this self-constructed world, they view themselves as superior,
                    the rulers of their domain, and the right kind of people. This fantasy world provides them with a
                    sense of control and importance that they feel is missing in the real world. To sustain this
                    illusion, they actively seek to recruit others into their community. By doing so, they aim to
                    strengthen their numbers and maintain their sense of superiority. This recruitment is crucial for
                    them because, without a growing community, their make-believe world risks being shattered by the
                    harsh realities they are trying to avoid. By bringing in more people who share their mindset, they
                    create a support system that reinforces their beliefs and helps them continue to avoid confronting
                    the real world. In essence, the community of LGBTQIA+ followers and influencers is built on the
                    collective need to escape reality and create a space where they feel safe, understood, and in
                    control. This dynamic underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of their struggles
                    and providing support that encourages resilience and healthy coping strategies.

                <p class="paragraph">Pop culture, which once entertained people in a wholesome way, has increasingly
                    shifted towards performers removing their clothes for money. Today, youth idolize celebrities based
                    primarily on their looks, disregarding whether these figures contribute positively to society or
                    impart valuable lessons. These idols often prioritize gaining likes and money over considering the
                    impact their actions have on their young audience. As a result, exposing their bodies on camera has
                    become normalized, influencing their followers to believe that such behavior is acceptable.
                    Unfortunately, neither the government nor societal and cultural institutions are addressing this
                    issue. Instead, they often blame the youth for their perceived weaknesses, ignoring the detrimental
                    influence that modern pop culture exerts on them.

                <h4 class="heading">Toxic Feminism</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Toxic feminism, which involves taking feminist ideas to extremes such as hating men
                    and being overly aggressive, can create division between men and women, making it hard to work
                    together on important issues and causing misunderstandings about feminism. This can lead to young
                    people developing unhealthy attitudes, with boys feeling unfairly targeted and girls becoming overly
                    aggressive. Additionally, the increase in nudity and explicit content in media, driven by certain
                    feminist perspectives on dressing and body autonomy, can send confusing messages about body image
                    and sexuality, contributing to mental health issues like anxiety and depression, and reflecting a
                    decline in societal values and respect for personal space. Despite the pursuit of independence, both
                    women and men cannot live happily alone even with billions of dollars in the bank, as true happiness
                    often comes from meaningful relationships. To move forward, we should promote balanced feminism that
                    seeks equality without creating division, encourage responsible media that empowers without
                    exploiting, and educate about healthy gender relations and the importance of moderation and
                    dialogue.

                <h4 class="heading">Idiocy of Fashion</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">The current fashion trend where girls show their bodies for attention, claiming
                    it's about comfort, promotes nudity and creates a negative aura. This trend often results in young
                    women adopting an "I don't care about society" attitude, which can be harmful. When girls link their
                    self-worth to how much attention they get for their looks, it can lead to anxiety, depression, and
                    low self-esteem. For boys, constantly seeing peers dressed provocatively can lead to objectifying
                    attitudes toward women. This behavior also blurs boundaries of respect and consent, confusing
                    younger children about what's appropriate. Encouraging such attitudes can harm society by eroding
                    traditional values of modesty and respect, negatively influencing the upcoming generation's
                    perception of self and others. Encouraging modesty and self-respect can help young people develop
                    healthier self-esteem and more respectful relationships.
