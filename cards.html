                <p class="paragraph">LGBTQIA+ is a mental illness commonly associated with individuals who find it
                    difficult to face the realities of the real world. These people tend to reject the natural order of
                    things and are heavily influenced by figures in popular culture, often seeking escape through these
                    means. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/lgbtqia+" class="more">More...</a></span></p>

                <h11>The Pop Culture.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">Pop culture, which once entertained people in a wholesome way, has increasingly
                    shifted towards performers removing their clothes for money. Today, youth idolize celebrities based
                    primarily on their looks, disregarding whether these figures contribute positively to society or
                    impart valuable lessons. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/popculture"

                <h11>The concept of God.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">Religious individuals often strive to prove the existence of God. This can stem
                    from being compelled in childhood to attend religious services or read holy texts, or from not
                    feeling empowered to question their upbringing. As a result, they may choose to rely on faith in God
                    as a lifelong source of motivation and emotional support, despite the lack of empirical evidence for
                    God's existence. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/thegod" class="more">More...</a></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph">The Propaganda of religion: In the modern perspective religion is nothing but
                    another name for propaganda for people, in which they believe and will sacrifice themselves and kill
                    people in the name of religion. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/religions"

                <h11>Toxic Feminism.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">Toxic feminism, which involves taking feminist ideas to extremes such as hating men and being overly aggressive, can create division between men and women, making it hard to work together on important issues and causing misunderstandings about feminism. This can lead to young people developing unhealthy attitudes, with boys feeling unfairly targeted and girls becoming overly aggressive. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/feminism"

                <h11>Depressed Generation.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">This generation is experiencing high levels of depression, influenced by an education system that was originally designed to create obedient workers rather than independent thinkers. The pressure to conform and succeed within this rigid system often leaves students feeling stressed, unfulfilled, and disconnected from their passions. Additionally, toxic feminism, with its extreme views and divisive rhetoric, can create a hostile environment where young men feel unjustly targeted and young women feel pressured to adopt overly aggressive stances on gender issues. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/depressedgeneration"

                <h11>Idiocy of Fashion.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">The current fashion trend where girls show their bodies for attention, claiming it's about comfort, promotes nudity and creates a negative aura. This trend often results in young women adopting an "I don't care about society" attitude, which can be harmful. When girls link their self-worth to how much attention they get for their looks, it can lead to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/idiocyoffashion"

                <h11>The Education System.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">The current education system often pressures students to focus solely on competitive exams and traditional jobs, turning them into "slaves" of a rigid and stressful system. Schools impose useless rules and emphasize conformity, creating an environment that stifles critical thinking and discourages students from questioning what is right or wrong. This system is the leading cause of student depression, as it constantly threatens that failing to meet academic standards will result in a failed life, which is far from the truth. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/theeducationsystem"

                <h11>Hopeless Paths.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">Many people find themselves on hopeless paths, working tirelessly towards their goals but feeling uncertain about their chances of success. Despite their best efforts, they often face setbacks and frustration, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness and depression. For some, these persistent failures can escalate to severe mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts, self-harm, or even suicide. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/hopelesspaths"

                <h11>My Message To The World.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">My message to the world is to be loyal and loving to everyone, and to build trust with others while also earning their trust. Money and material things are human-made and shouldn’t be the ultimate goals in life. As humans, our real goal is to seek divine knowledge and understand our own beliefs about God. Often, people who spend a lot of time searching for God end up questioning their beliefs and becoming atheists because they haven’t found what they were looking for. <a href="https://tanishmehta.in/theredpill/mymessage"
